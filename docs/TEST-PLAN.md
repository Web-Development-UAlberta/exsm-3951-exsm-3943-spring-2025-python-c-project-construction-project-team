## Success and Error Conditions

### Overall Success Criteria
- at least 2 homeowners complete full test journey
- At least one contractor submits a quote
- at least 1 contractor user performs end-to-end quote process
- Create and submit at least 1 RFQ
- View filtered galleries
- Upload relevant files

### Database Constraints

- Username: Unique
- Error on duplicates

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Expected Results |
|----------|------------------|
| `POST /api/user/register` | 201 Created or 400 Validation Error |
| `POST /api/user/authorize` | 200 JWT or 401 Unauthorized |
| `GET /api/user?id={id}` | 200 OK or 400/401/403/404 errors |

### Frontend Interactions

#### `/login`
- Form sends encoded Authorization header to `/api/user/authorize`
- Errors shown per field or general message

#### `/profile`
- Sends `FormData` with JWT
- Redirect or error based on status codes
